# Motor with Relay

## Goals:
- [x] Build minimal circuits to control feeder with raspberry pi
- [x] Use single power supply
- [x] Control relay
- [x] Run single motor iteration without the help of any switch

## Results:
- UY connectors are very handy to build circuit prototypes
- Be mindful of relay state when program is stopped
- Relying on timed motor iterations could work for some time, but will be problematic in long run
- Hardware almost complete:
  - Add at least one switch to control motor iterations
  - Adjust and reprint camera mount base
