# Telegram Bot

## Goals:
- [x] Create Telegram bot
- [x] Send either newest or specific photo via bot 

## Results:
- Use GitHub secrets for future Telegram tokens 
- Execution time is already quite long, especially without specified image. It is probably better to wrap everything within the same module, to keep loading times short.
- Run finished program as systemd service?
