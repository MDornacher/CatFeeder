# Cat vs. Human

## Goals:
- [x] Check hardware compatibility
- [x] Use OpenCV with pre-trained CascadeClassifier

## Results:
- Install OpenCV with `apt install python3-opencv` instead of using `pip`
- Custom CascadeClassifier is needed to distinguish our cats([Cascade Classifier Training](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html)) 
- [Teachable Machine](teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) as beginner friendly alternative
